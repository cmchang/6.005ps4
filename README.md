========

The purpose of this problem set is to give you experience with GUI programming. In particular you will be using Java Swing. 
Finally, you will get more practice with multithreading.

Overview from the pset:

In this problem set, you will implement a simple Jotto playing client that communicates with a server that we have 
provided for you. If youâ€™ve never played the game, you can find a short description of Jotto on Wikipedia.

In our particular version of the game, the client selects a puzzle ID at random (starting with 1) which corresponds 
to a secret 5-letter word on the server. The user can then submit 5-letter dictionary word guesses to the server, 
which will respond with the number of letters in common between the two words and the number of letters in the correct 
position.
